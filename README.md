*This is a React component that displays a list of users from the JSONPlaceholder API, and allows the user to search through the list using a search box. Here is an overview of the code:

*The component starts by importing the useEffect and useState hooks from the react package, and a SCSS file to add some styling.

*Inside the component function, there are three state variables defined using the useState hook: users, searchTerm, and isOpen. The users state variable holds an array of user objects fetched from the API. The searchTerm state variable holds the current value of the search box. The isOpen state variable is used to toggle the search box.

*The useEffect hook is used to fetch the user data from the API when the component mounts. If the searchTerm state is empty, it will fetch all the users. Otherwise, it will filter the list of users based on the searchTerm state.

*The onInputChange function is called every time the user types in the search box. It updates the searchTerm state with the current value of the search box.

*The handleOpen and handleClose functions are used to toggle the isOpen state when the search box is focused and when the close button is clicked, respectively.

*The search box consists of an input field and a close button that is only visible when the input field is focused. The card container is a list of user cards, each with an avatar, a name, and an email.

*The map function is used to loop through the users array and render a card for each user using JSX.
